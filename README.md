# React + Vite
ðŸŒ¦ Explore My New Weather App Powered by React JS and OpenWeatherMap API! ðŸŒ¦
Iâ€™m excited to present my latest projectâ€”a Weather App developed with React JS that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather updates. Enter any city, state, or country to get precise details on Temperature, Weather Condition, Humidity, and Wind Speed.
Built with: React, Vite, Node, CSS.
See how the OpenWeatherMap API integrates seamlessly to offer a smooth, interactive weather experience!
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
